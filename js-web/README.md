#### Why Svelte?

Svelte is one of the latest JS frameworks that is much closer to HTML compared to React or VueJS.
It is also much faster compared to others. We believe more companies will start using a component
library like Svelte in near future. Also, if you are able to use Svelte than learning or using
VueJS or React should not be an issue.
