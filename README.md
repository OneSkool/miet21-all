## About this Repository

This repository contains templates for projects used in JobReady Training as base projects.

At the start of a training batch, OneSkool's staff would clone a project from here to setup a new repo for
each team in a batch.

## Project Template Types

Following project templates are available:

- java-web: This is a Spring Boot based java web application that can be used to create microservices.
- js-web (TODO): This is a javascript project to create frontend. This frontend can be used to create SPAs.

## Supported OS

Projects have been tested on Windows and Mac laptops for local development.

Since projects are eventually containerized and deployed on Linux containers, Linux based laptops should also work
for local development.

## Setup Instructions

This repository contains projects as well as documentation that can be used to get students up and running with the base project created from templates.

> Follow the README.md files inside each project folder (java-web) to setup project on laptops. OneSkool JobReady program also use services to manage various aspects of the project. Students would need to create accounts at following services to get started:

### Accounts

- Github: Used to host project repositories (source code), practice good coding habits and work
